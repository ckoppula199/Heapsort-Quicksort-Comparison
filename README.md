# Heapsort-Quicksort-Comparison
Uses Java and Excel API to to run heapsort and quicksort on randomly generated arrays of varying sizes. Works out time and number of comparisons and swaps for each algorithm at each input size. Experiment is run 10 times in total and results are written to an excel spreadsheet and averages are also calculated and written to the spreadsheet.

Runs quicksort and heapsort 10 times with each time increasing the imput size by a set number, initially it is 100,000.
This whole proccess is then repeated 9 more times to give a total of 10 repetitions.
The results are then written to an excel spreadsheet in 10 seperate tables. 
There is an 11th table to the far right of the spreadsheet and this gives the averages of the previous 10 tables.
